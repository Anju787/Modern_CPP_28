QUESTION 

Class engine should have the following attributes
 - engine_id of type string
 - engine type which could be hybrid , ice or alternate_fuel
 - engine _cc which is a float 
 -engine_torque which is a float
 -engine_horsepower which is an int value


 Create the following functionalities in functional.cpp.
 1) Create 5 objects of the class engine on the heap. Attach a shared_ptr to each object created and emplace
 these shared_ptr into a list conatiner

         2) A function to return a container of shared_ptr pointing to objects which is 
        satisfy the predicate condition passed
 
        Hint : Accept a predicate, apply it on data container, identify objects that meet 
        predicate condition and return a container of pointers to such objects
 
        3) A function to find and return if at least one object meets a predicate condition passed
 
        4) A function to find the average m_engine_cc and return the value
