    A -> Essentials of Modern Cpp(fundamentals)
    B -> Functional Programming in Modern CPP 
    C -> Concurrency & C++ 17
    D -> STL DS & Algorithms

Features
    1. In class initialization(we can provide the default values to the variable.)
    2. Enum class usage to solve enum problems. 
    3. defaulted and deleted (Enable and disable) member functions.
        You can choose whether to enable or disable 6 special members functions for a 
        class you are creating

        a) Default constructor
        b) destructor
        c) copy constructor
        d) copy assignment operator = (overload = operator)
        e) move constructor (new feature in C++11)
        f) move assignment operator = (overload = operator for move)
    4. NULL is replaced with nullptr. //to differentiate between pointer null and 0
    5. uniform initialize 
        We can initialize variables in a function using {}
    6. Member list initialization
    7. auto keyword
            detect and infer the type of variables Based on Initial value
    8. Constructor delegation
        You can transfer/shift constrol of the program from one constructor to another IN THE SAME CLASS 
    9. Additional numberic types with specific size in memory
    10. For-each (range-based for loop)
    11. Emplace data in containers (in-place construction of values within the container)
    12. "using" keyword is used to create an alias for the long datatypes.







Employee ::
    1.28
    2.35
    3.29

Arrangements::
    A) consecutively, one after the other in memory
        a) No option for adding no data will be provided[Array]
            [       28      |      35      |      29      ]
                  0x100H          0x1004H        0x108H
        b) We can add more data values if required, in future[Vector]
            [       28      |       35      |       29  
                0x100H          0x104H         0x108H

    Vectors will slow down the process because if a new element is added
    and if there is no space in consecutive location then the whole data is 
    relocated to another memory location. 

        Employee 4 : 36 
            [       28      |       35      |       29      |////
                 0x100H          0x1004H         0x108H      ////
                    TRANSFER TO A NEW REGION IN MEMORY 
             [       28      |       35      |       29      |////
                    0x200H          0x204H         0x208H     ////
    Hence vector arrangements is not the best choice for adding new data and storing.
